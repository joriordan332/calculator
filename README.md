# calculator

I felt like this project helped consolidate everything learnt on foundations so far. I felt comfortable working through each of the requirements until it got to making the calculator work. To get my head around problem I referred back the the problem solving lesson and wrote out pseudocode and an algorithm to break the problem down and make the calculator work. In order to programme the necessary logic I decided to use if statements to check if my variables did/didn't contain a value. 
Upon reflection and reviewing other code after I finished the project I would go about things differently next time so that the code is easier to read. Other code I looked over used event listeners and linked functions inside of them which seemed easier to follow than mine. Overall I'm satisfied with how it turned out.
